# Buffer-Net
BufferNet
A deep-learning framework for detecting genus of bacteria was designed. It utilizes buffer and down sampling layers to extract the spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral microscopic images.   

The description of each source code:

Directory model:  Pretrained weights of the model were saved as .pth format. We uploaded it at https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive. And we suggested that the weight file should be placed in this directory.

BufferNet.py:
The architecture of BufferNet was implemented as a class bufferNet. 


BufferNet_main.py:
In this file, loading data, training and testing networks were implemented. The function, plot_confusion_matrix, could be used to present the confusion matrix of classification.
